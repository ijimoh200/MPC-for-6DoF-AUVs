#### Tube-based-MPC-with-LOS-replanning

Provides MATLAB code for implementing the tube-based MPC with LOS replanning, using the Naminow-D AUV as a case study. The repository also contains a nonlinear MPC controller used as a benchmark for the tube MPC. The functions TMPC\_Ra1, TMPC\_Ra2 and TMPC\_Ra3 implement the Chapter 6 TMPC controller with different tuned values of the sphere of acceptance radius Ra, to illustrate the effect of the radius on performance.

NB: The NMPC function is computationally expensive, which can take a considerable amount of time to run on a relatively slow PC.
