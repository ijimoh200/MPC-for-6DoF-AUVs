## Duality-based Feedback Min-Max MMPC for 3D Path Following
This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the accelerated feedback Min-Max MPC with a multi-objective line-of-sight guidance system (MO-LOSGS) for 3D path-following by coupled AUVs operating in the presence of obstacles. The code requires the Yalmip solver to be installed in the MATLAB path.

The repository is for the algorithm presented in Chapter 7 of the book: **Robust Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.

The following input and output variables are defined for the main function fMM-MPC that implements the accelerated feedback min-max MPC algorithm:
