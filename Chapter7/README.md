# Accelerated-Min-Max-Model-Predictive-Control-for-AUV-Path-Following-in-Uncertain-Environments
This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the accelerated Min-Max MPC with a multi-objective line-of-sight guidance system (MO-LOSGS) for coupled AUVs operating in the presence of obstacles. The code requires the SeDuMi solver to be installed in the MATLAB path.
