# MPC-for-6DoF-AUVs
This repository presents the MATLAB codes used to implement the MPC algorithms in the book: **Robust Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.
The MATLAB implementation is structured in a modular fashion at the functional level, but it does not incorporate a class-based architectural design. While the authors acknowledge that highly modular code can be advantageous in large-scale systems, a script-driven functional approach is adopted to enhance readability and facilitate the reuse of specific components, especially in academic or instructional contexts. The m-files are organised into separate functions dedicated to the nonlinear AUV model, control algorithms, reference generation, local replanning, and predictive matrix construction.
