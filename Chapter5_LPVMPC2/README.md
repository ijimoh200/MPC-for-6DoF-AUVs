## Velocity Form LPVMPC2 Strategy
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the velocity-form LPVMPC2 based on a reachable set for integrated trajectory tracking and point stabilisation. The algorithm is described in detail in Sections 5.4 & 5.5 of Chapter 5 of the book **Robust Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.

The MATLAB code validates the control algorithm using the Naminow-D AUV and compares its performance with the delta input form algorithm for Case 1, which considered integrated trajectory tracking and dynamic positioning control of the AUV.
