#### Velocity Form LPVMPC2 Strategy



This repository contains MATLAB and Python implementations of the velocity-form MPC based on a reachable set for integrated trajectory tracking and point stabilisation. The MATLAB code validates the control algorithm using the Naminow-D AUV, while the Python code demonstrates validation with the BlueROV2.
